Fetch a list of countries in JSON format from this URL:   https://gist.githubusercontent.com/peymano-wmt/32dcb892b06648910ddd40406e37fdab/raw/db25946fd77c5873b0303b858e861ce724e0dcd0/countries.json     

Fetch a list of countries in JSON format from this URL: 

https://gist.githubusercontent.com/peymano-wmt/32dcb892b06648910ddd40406e37fdab/raw/db25946fd77c5873b0303b858e861ce724e0dcd0/countries.json 

  

2. Display all the countries in a RecyclerView ordered by the position they appear in the JSON. In each table cell, show the country's "name", "region", "code" and "capital" in this format: 

  --------------------------------------- 

  |                                     | 

  | "name", "region"             "code" | 

  |                                     | 

  | "capital"                           | 

  |                                     | 

  --------------------------------------- 

  For example: 

  --------------------------------------- 

  |                                     | 

  | United States of America, NA     US | 

  |                                     | 

  | Washington, D.C.                    | 

  |                                     | 

  --------------------------------------- 

  |                                     | 

  | Uruguay, SA                      UY | 

  |                                     | 

  | Montevideo                          | 

  |                                     | 

  --------------------------------------- 

  

The user should be able to scroll thru the entire list of countries. 

  

3. The implementation should be robust (i.e., handle errors and edge cases) and support device rotation. 

Limit yourself to whatever time you have. 

 

The goal is to write high-quality code for the portion you choose to implement, not the number of features implemented. 

 

Show your best in this minimal project scope. 

 

Do’s and don’t 

Use coroutines 
Do not use Compose 
Do not use Dagger 
No deps injections
 

Friendly tips:

•   Please do not focus on just the implementation – error handling is very important

•   Make sure the networking code is clean, production level

 

Additional tips:

Use DiffUtil for optimization
Use Fragment, Usecase, list adapter
Use domain layer with mapper, submitList, mannual DI
